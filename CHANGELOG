1. Claps - This addresses an issue where the buffer was overrun by increasing
           the buffer size, and by adding a diagnostic message.

2. Belos - Added Belos support for Tpetra (autoconf).  Added test (MVOPTester)
           of Belos adaptor.  Added Belos adaptor, stubs only (throws
           exceptions).

3. Zoltan - Bug 4224.  Changing LB_Free_Part from a Zoltan class member method
            to a static method.

4. Zoltan - Adding support of sequential scotch ordering.

5. Sacado - Bug 4230.  Conditionally turning off build of pce_example.

13. ML - Put in 2 ifdefs so ML can be compiled with aztecoo.

14. ML - Added some utilities to check whether the ghost numbering matches the
         blocking structure when num_PDEs is greater than 1.

15. Zoltan - Added the support of vertex weights for ordering with Scotch.
             Also corrected the handling of compressed matrix market files in
             zdrive when built with autotools.

             partitioning.

18. Zoltan - Removed a duplicated declaration of METIS_NodeND.

25. Zoltan - Bug 4286.  Cleaning the code: deletion of compilation warnings.

26. Zoltan - Fixed special case of zero objs on processor and
             RETURN_LISTS=PARTITION_ASSIGNMENTS

27. Zoltan - Updated version number to 3.101.

28. Anasazi - User-submitted bug: SVQBOrthoManager normalize() failed for all-
              zero multivector. Added test to document the bug, then fixed it.

29. FEI - A performance optimization and other minor fixes for issues
          encountered by Sierra applications.
