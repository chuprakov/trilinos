1. Epetra            - Fix performance hot spot in Epetra_FEVector.

2. Epetra            - Fix a checked stl bug in Epetra_FECrsMatrix.

3. EpetraExt         - Use correct Epetra_MpiComm object for HDF5 class.

4. EpetraExt         - Fix missing return in restrict_comm.

5. Multiple Packages - Fix Clang/llvm build errors in several packages. Trilinos
                       now builds with Clang/llvm.

6. Zoltan            - Address a few compiler issues.

Release update 10.10.1 February 22, 2012

1. Epetra          - Removed references to Epetra_MpiSmpComm.h from
                     EpetraExt_HDF5.cpp. This file is not distributed and was
                     causing build failures.

2. Epetra          - Fixed two assignements to NULL that were supposed to be
                     comparisons against NULL in Epetra_FEVector.

3. Epetra          - Add missing over-ride of InsertGlobalValues to FECrsMatrix.

4. Epetra          - Improve performance of non-local data insertion in
                     FECrsMatrix.

4. Framework Level - Fixed an issue where the installed cmake export files
                     referenced the wrong directory for include files when
                     Trilinos_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR was specified manually. The
                     issue stemmed from a change to support installers that can
                     change the install directory at install time instead of
                     relying on the configure time settings. The fix allows both
                     an installer to change the installation path and manually
                     setting the variable Trilinos_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR provided
                     that it is relative to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. This relative
                     restriction has actually been silently assumed in the
                     makefile export files for some time it is now a stated
                     restriction to the entire export system.
