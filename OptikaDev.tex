This section of the report discusses the developement of the Optika package.

\section{Early Development}
Development of Optika began in Fall of 2008. Dr. Mike Heroux identified a need for
the Trilinos framework to include some sort of GUI package. Dr. Heroux wanted 
to give users of the framework the ability to easily generate GUIs for their
programs, while still providing a good experiennce for the end user. Based on
previous GUI work done for the Tramonto project, a few initial problems were
identified:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How would the GUI be laid out?
		\item Different types of parameters require different methods of input.
			How would we decide how we would obtain input for a particular
			parameter?
		\item What framework would we use to build the GUI?
		\item How would the application developer specify parameters for the
			GUI to obtain?
	\end{itemize}
After some deliberation, the following initial solutions were decided upon:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The GUI would be laid out in a hierarchical fashion. With
		parameters organized into lists and sublists.

	\end{itemize}
