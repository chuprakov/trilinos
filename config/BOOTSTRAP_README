I, Ken Stanley, wrote this as I was trying to figure out how the 
autotools process as used in Trilinos.  I originally intended to 
include it in each bootstrap file.  However, since there are many 
copies of bootstrap, decided to put it here instead.  My comments 
here are based on empricial evidence, not on actual understanding 
of the auto tools suite.  

BUGS:  I don't know how to make distclean work - should be documented

#
#  To add capabilities to the Makefile which configure builds, you change
#  one or more of the following files:  configure.ac, config/*.m4, 
#  Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am 
#
#  This script runs aclocal, autoheader, automake and autoconf, which 
#  together form the "Auto tools" package.
#
#  Check Trilinos/config/AutotoolsVersionInfo and make sure that you 
#  you have the right version of both automake and autoconf.
#
#  Complete documentation and software can be found at:

#  INPUT AND OUTPUT FOR EACH OF THE STEPS IN bootstrap:
#  ====================================================
#
#  The auto tools package in some cases, creates files only if it 
#  has to and otherwise uses existing files.  In each case, our 
#  use of auto tools is such that the files that are created are
#  identical (except for one comment line in one file) to the ones 
#  that we provide to it.  I refer to these files as "IN or OUT" 
#  because they are used if they are there, and created otherwise.
