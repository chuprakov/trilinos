TODOs for the Trilinos/CMake system

Last updated: 2008/09/28

(*) [Ross] Create a macro TRILINOS_PACKAGES(...) that will do a bunch of stuff
needed to declare a new pacakge.

- Define some package-specific variables:
  PACKAGE_NAME
  PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR
  PACKAGE_BINARY_DIR

- Check that certain variables have been defined correctly

(*) [Ross] Add support for package dependanices and all the goodies

- Create a stub file like Trilinos/pacakges/PACKAGE/cmake/Dependencies.cmake
that gets read before processing any of the packages.  This file will define
variables like:

   ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_REQUIRED_DEP_PACAKGES
   ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES
   ${PACKAGE_NAME}_TEST_REQUIRED_DEP_PACAKGES
   ${PACKAGE_NAME}_TEST_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES

- For each optional dependent library package, add the global cache option
${PACAKGE_NAME}_ENABLE_${DEP_PACAKGE_NAME}.  In addition, this option will be
set to ON if Trilinos_ENABLE_${PACKAGE_NAME}=ON and
Trilinos_ENABLE_${DEP_PACKAGE_NAME}=ON

- When Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACAKGES is defined, enable all
packages that depend on the current set of explicitly enabled packages.

- When Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES is enabled, then enable all
optional packages that currently enabled packages can use (i.e. every pacakges
listed in ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES and, if tests or exmaples
are enabled, those in ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES)

- Enable all required dependent library packages (i.e. those specified in
{PACAKGE_NAME}_LIB_REQUIRED_DEP_PACKAGES and, if tests or examples are enabled,
those in ${PACKAGE_NAME}_TEST_REQUIRED_DEP_PACAKGES)

(*) [Esteban] Set up our own CDash results for Trilinos serial and mpi

- Set up area on software.sandia.gov for to host CDash:
  + https://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/developer/cdash-results
  + Meet with Danny D. to get this set up
  + See about getting some type of email alerts set out (at least to
    rabartl and ejguill)

- Set up a MS Windows test machine feeding into Trilinos dashbaord
  + Talk with Danny D. and Bill Goldman
  + Get automated builds/tests with CTest/CDash running

- Set up a MAC test machine feeding into Trilinos dashboard
  + Look into s858352. Talk with Mary Meinelt (msmeine@sandia.gov).
  + Look for another machine:  Sugesstion: Send reqeust to

(*) [Esteban] Experiment with creating MS Windows Visual Studio project files

(*) [Esteban] Experiment with using CPack to create a MS Windows binary
installer

(*) [Everyone] Expand TrlinosCMakeQuickstart.txt
- Configuring Trilinos to build
- Getting debug output
- Building
- Running tests (cmake and runtests-[serial,mpi])
- Will lead into
