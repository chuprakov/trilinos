TODOs for the Trilinos/CMake system

Last updated: 2008/09/28

(*) [Ross] Create python script to checkout, untar, build, and install CMake
in one shot.

(*) [Ross] Add automatic Fortran 77 name mangling

(*) [Ross] Add automatic demangle checking

(*) [Ross] Add nightly cron job on thumper.sandia.gov to test
Trilinos/CMake serial debug and MPI optimized and submit to dashboard.

(*) [Ross] Add unit testing infrastructure for
TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(...), TRILINOS_ADD_TEST(...).  These unit
tests will serve both as tests and as documentation.

(*) [Ross] Add the package name as a prefix to all test and example
executables.  This will require changes to the
TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(..) and TRILINOS_ADD_TEST(...) functions.  It
will also require changes to all of the existing Makefile.am files
that create these tests in the autotools system and in the
test/definition files.

(*) [Ross] Clean up tests and examples:

- Move (almost) all tests into subdirectories since that is the right thing to
do.

(*) [Ross] Add a 'libs' target to rebuild only libraries so that we can skip
unecessary relinking when shared libraries are used

(*) [Ross] Add a POSTFIXES argument to TRILNOS_ADD_[EXECUTABLE_AND_]TEST(...) 
to replace the silly numeric numbering.  This will be important for keeping
track of test results for different enables/disables.

(*) [Esteban] Set up our own CDash results for Trilinos serial and mpi

- Set up a MS Windows test machine feeding into Trilinos dashbaord
  + Get automated builds/tests with CTest/CDash running on Esteban
  + Get CVS update working

- Set up a linux machine to do nightly builds of serial debug and mpi optimized
  to send to dashboard
  + Set up SSH tunnelling to SSG

- Set up a MAC test machine feeding into Trilinos dashboard
  + Look into s858352. Talk with Mary Meinelt (msmeine@sandia.gov).
  + Look for another machine:  Sugesstion: Send reqeust to

- Add 'serial' and 'mpi' categories to dashboard on trilinos.sandia.gov

(*) [Esteban] Experiment with using CPack to create a MS Windows binary
installer (NSIS)

- Post a installer exe file on software.sandia.gov (hidden) and send
out link in an email to Trilinos-Announce allowing others to get
Trilinos.

(*) [Everyone] Expand TrlinosCMakeQuickstart.txt
- Configuring Trilinos to build
- Getting debug output
- Building
- Running tests (cmake and runtests-[serial,mpi])
- Will lead into a rewriting of the Trilinos Developers Guide

(*) [Esteban] Add the Trilinos LGPL license to the NSIS installer

(*) [Ross and Esteban] Write unit tests for all important Trilinos Cmake
macros (like TRILINOS_ADD_[EXECUTABLE,TEST,EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST)(...) etc.)
