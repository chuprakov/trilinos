TODOs for the Trilinos/CMake system

Last updated: 2008/09/28

(*) [Ross] Clean up tests and examples:

- Combine all separate calls to TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(...) and
TRILNOS_ADD_TEST(...) to a single TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST(...) that
you can.

- Move (almost) all tests into subdirectories since that is the right thing to
do.

(*) [Ross] Add support for package dependanices and all the goodies

- Loop through right away and disable all packages that must be disabled due
to required dependent packages being disabled.

- After all other enables/disables have been performed, enable all required
dependent packages (i.e. those specified in
{PACAKGE_NAME}_LIB_REQUIRED_DEP_PACKAGES and, if tests or examples are
enabled, those in ${PACKAGE_NAME}_TEST_REQUIRED_DEP_PACAKGES)

- When Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACAKGES is defined, for the set of
pacakges directly enabled by the user, enable all packages that depend these
pacakges (all required and optional, library and test/example dependencies).

- When Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES is enabled, for the set of
packages directly enabled by the user, enable all optional packages can use
these packages (i.e. every packge listed in
${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES and, if tests or exmaples are
enabled, those in ${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_OPTIONAL_DEP_PACAKGES)

(*) [Esteban] Set up our own CDash results for Trilinos serial and mpi

- Set up area on software.sandia.gov for to host CDash:
  + https://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/developer/cdash-results
  + Meet with Danny D. to get this set up
  + See about getting some type of email alerts set out (at least to
    rabartl and ejguill)

- Set up a MS Windows test machine feeding into Trilinos dashbaord
  + Talk with Danny D. and Bill Goldman
  + Get automated builds/tests with CTest/CDash running

- Set up a MAC test machine feeding into Trilinos dashboard
  + Look into s858352. Talk with Mary Meinelt (msmeine@sandia.gov).
  + Look for another machine:  Sugesstion: Send reqeust to

(*) [Esteban] Experiment with creating MS Windows Visual Studio project files

(*) [Esteban] Experiment with using CPack to create a MS Windows binary
installer

(*) [Everyone] Expand TrlinosCMakeQuickstart.txt
- Configuring Trilinos to build
- Getting debug output
- Building
- Running tests (cmake and runtests-[serial,mpi])
- Will lead into a rewriting of the Trilinos Developers Guide
