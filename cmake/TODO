TODOs for the Trilinos/CMake system

Last updated: 2008/08/04

(*) Clean up all PACKAGE/test/CMakeList.txt to be a clean as possible
- Remove the direct calls INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(...) and LINK_LIBRARIES(...) 
... Done for 'test' but not 'example' ...
- Remove all calls to TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST(...) with
separate calls to TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(...) and
TRILINOS_ADD_TEST(...) ... done for 'test' but not 'example' ...

(*) Finish custom target for 'runtests-serial' and 'runtests-mpi' to run the
perl 'runtest' script
- Figure out PROJECT_DIR_NAME automatically from CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR and
put this logic in TrilinosRuntestsTargets.cmake

(*) TRILINOS_ADD_TEST(...) upgrades
- Add the number of processes that an MPI test is being run with to the name
of the test.  This will allow you to see just from the main output how many
processors are selected to run with.
- Look into changing the print width for ctest since it is truncating
long test names.

(*) Set up out own CDash results for Trilinos serial and mpi
- Find machine and time to run build (exetazo or regresssion.sandia.gov)
- Find machine and host resuls (software.sandia.gov)
- Meet with Danny D. to go over process to set this up
- See about getting some type of email alert

(*) Write skeleton for new Trilinos Developers Guide with CMake instead of
autotools ... ON GOING ...
- Give to Jim W. to see if you can actually use cmake to build and test
Trilinos


Completed:
----------

(*) TRILINOS_ADD_TEST(...) upgrades
- Add the package name to the beginning test name [Done]
- Change the separator for the test index name from '_' to '-' [Done]
- Change KEYWORDS to create postfix names to the end of the test name (but
before the arbitrary number) [Done]
- Enable and test absent DIRECTORY argument [Done]

- Get rid of MPI_EXECUTABLE_FLAGS in ConfigureMPI.cmake once
TRILINOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST(....) is gone. [Done]
