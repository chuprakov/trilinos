# Function that creates a set of template code client headers that either
# includes or does not include the template instantiations depending on
# whether implicit or explicit instantiation is supported or not.
#
# Usage:
#
#    TRIBITS_CREATE_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS(
#      BASE_DIR
#      [NOSIERRABJAM]
#      )
#
# The arguments are:
#
#  BASE_DIR
#
#    The base directory where files with the extension *_decl.hpp will be
#    globed for.
#
#  NOSIERRABJAM
#
#    If set, then the files will not be written in the SIERRA/bjam directory
#    for SIERRA to pick up.  This option would be used for template code that
#    is only used in tests and not in libraries.
