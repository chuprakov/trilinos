This example program illustrate how to construct an equivalent real
problem from a complex valued problem for several situations.  The 
program solves the real-valued problem using AztecOO and the constructs
the solution to the complex-valued problem.

This example works with Trilinos 9.0 and later.

Files included in this directory:

Makefile - a sample make file that works with an installed version of Trilinos.
You must edit this makefile to make sure that the Makefile.export.* files are pointed to.

invoke-configure - a sample configure invocation script.  To use this script, edit
it to provide your local file system information.  Then do the following:

source invoke-configure
make
make install

cxx_main.cpp - the main program.
