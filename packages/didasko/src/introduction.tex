\section{Getting Started}
\label{sec:getting}

The Trilinos framework uses a two level software structure that connects
a system of {\sl packages}. A Trilinos package is an integral unit,
usually developed to solve a specific task, by a (relatively) small
group of experts.  Packages exist beneath the Trilinos top level,
which provides a common look-and-feel. Each package has its own
structure, documentation and set of examples, and it is possibly
available independently of Trilinos. However, each package is even more
valuable when combined with other Trilinos packages.

\smallskip

Trilinos is a large software project, and currently about forty
packages are included.  The entire set of packages covers a wide range
of algorithms and enabling technologies for the solution of large-scale,
complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems, as well as a
large set of utilities to improve the development of software for scientific
computing.

Clearly, a full understanding all the functionalities of the Trilinos
packages requires time.  Each package offers sophisticated features,
difficult to ``unleash'' at a first sight.  Besides that, a detailed
description of each Trilinos package is beyond the scope of this
document. For these reasons, the goal of this tutorial is to ensure that
users have the background to make good use of the extensive
documentation contained in each package.
%For a
%successive fine-tuning phase, users still must look through individual
%package's documentation and examples.

\medskip

We will describe the following subset of the Trilinos packages.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Epetra}. The package defines the basic classes for
  distributed matrices and vectors, linear operators and linear
  problems. Epetra classes are the common language spoken by all the
  Trilinos packages (even if some packages can ``speak'' other
  languages). Each Trilinos package accepts as input Epetra objects.
  This allows powerful combinations among the various Trilinos
  functionalities.
\item {\bf Triutils}. This is a collection of utilities that are useful
  in software development. Here, we present a command line parser and a
  matrix generator, that are used throughout this document to define
  example matrices.
\item {\bf AztecOO}. This is a linear solver package based on
  preconditioned Krylov methods. Aztec users will find that AztecOO
  supports all the Aztec interfaces and functionality, and also provides
  significant new functionality.
\item {\bf Belos}. Provides next-generation iterative linear solvers and a
powerful linear solver developer framework.
\item {\bf IFPACK}. The package performs various incomplete
  factorizations, and is here used with AztecOO.
\item {\bf Teuchos}. This is a collection of classes that can be
  essential for advanced code development.
\item {\bf ML}. The algebraic multilevel and domain decomposition
  preconditioner package provides scalable preconditioning capabilities
  for a variety of problems. It is here used as a preconditioner
  for AztecOO solvers.
\item {\bf Amesos}. The package provides a common interface to certain
  sparse direct linear solvers (generally available outside the Trilinos
  framework), both sequential and parallel.
\item {\bf Anasazi}. The package provides a common interface to parallel eigenvalue
  and eigenvector solvers, for both symmetric and non-symmetric linear problems.
\item {\bf NOX}. This is a collection of nonlinear solvers, designed to
  be easily integrated into an application and used with many different
  linear solvers.
\item {\bf Zoltan}. A toolkit of parallel services for dynamic, unstructured,
and/or adaptive simulations. Zoltan provides parallel dynamic load balancing
and related services for a wide variety of applications, including finite
element methods, matrix operations, particle methods, and crash simulations. 
\item {\bf Tpetra}. Next-generation, templated version of Petra, taking
advantage of the newer advanced features of C++. 
\item {\bf Didasko}. This package contains all the examples reported in this
tutorial. The sources of the examples can be found in the subdirectory\\
\verb!<your-trilinos-home>/packages/didasko/examples!.
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:tripackages} gives a partial overview of what can be
accomplished using Trilinos.

\begin{remark}
  As already pointed out, Epetra objects are meant to be the ``common
  language'' spoken by all the Trilinos packages, and are a natural
  starting point. For new users, Chapters
  \ref{chap:epetra_vec}-\ref{chap:epetra_others} are a prerequisite to
  the later chapters. Chapters~\ref{chap:triutils} is not essential to
  understand Trilinos, but the functionalities there presented are used
  in this document as a starting point for many examples.  One of the
  classes described in Chapter~\ref{chap:teuchos}, the
  Teuchos::ParameterList, is later used in Chapters~\ref{chap:ml} and
  \ref{chap:amesos}.  Chapter~\ref{chap:aztecoo} should be read before
  Chapters~\ref{chap:ifpack} and~\ref{chap:ml} (even if both IFPACK and
  ML can be compiled and run without AztecOO).
\end{remark}

The only prerequisites assumed in this tutorial are some familiarities
with numerical methods for PDEs, and with iterative linear and nonlinear
solvers. Although not strictly necessary, the reader is assumed to have
some familiarity with distributed memory computing and, to a lesser
extent, with MPI\footnote{Although almost no explicit MPI instructions
  are required in a Trilinos code, the reader should be aware of the
  basic concepts of message passing, like the definition of a
  communicator.}.

\smallskip

Note that this tutorial is not a substitute for individual packages'
documentation. Also, for an overview of all the Trilinos packages, the
Trilinos philosophy, and a description of the packages provided by
Trilinos, the reader is referred to \cite{Trilinos-Overview}.
Developers should also consider the Trilinos Developers' Guide, which
addresses many topics, including the development tools used by Trilinos'
developers, and a description of how to include a new package.

\section{Programming Language Used in this Tutorial}
\label{sec:language}

Trilinos is written in C++ (for most packages), and in C. Some
interfaces are provided to FORTRAN codes (mainly BLAS and LAPACK
routines). Even if limited support is included for C programs (and a
more limited for FORTRAN code), to unleash the full power of Trilinos we
recommend C++. All the example programs contained in this tutorial are
in C++; some packages (like ML) contain examples in C.

\section{A Note on the Directory Structure}
\label{sec:into_note}

Each Trilinos package in contained in the subdirectory
\begin{verbatim}
<your-trilinos-directory>/packages
\end{verbatim}
Each package generally contains sources, examples, tests and documentation
subdirectories:
\begin{verbatim}
<your-trilinos-directory>/packages/<package-name>/src
<your-trilinos-directory>/packages/<package-name>/examples
<your-trilinos-directory>/packages/<package-name>/test
<your-trilinos-directory>/packages/<package-name>/doc
\end{verbatim}
Developers' documentation is written using Doxygen\footnote{Copyright
  \copyright 1997-2003 by Dimitri van Heesch. More information can by
  found at the web address {\tt
    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}.}.  The Doxygen documentation, and
other available documentation, for each package is available online via 

\begin{verbatim}
http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/<package-name>/documentation.html
\end{verbatim}

The Doxygen documentation can also be generated from the source code directly
when accessing a version-controlled copy of the Trilinos source code.  For
some packages, Doxygen documentation can also be generated from the 
distribution tarball.

 For example, to create
the documentation for Epetra, use the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd <your-trilinos-home>/packages/epetra/doc
$ doxygen
\end{verbatim}
Generally, both HTML and \LaTeX~documentation are created by Doxygen.
The browser of choice can be used to walk through the HTML
documentation.  To compile the \LaTeX~sources, the commands are:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cd <your-trilinos-home>/packages/epetra/doc/latex
$ make
\end{verbatim}
