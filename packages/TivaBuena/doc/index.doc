\section TivaBuena_intro Introduction 
The TivaBuena package is intended to give Trilinos Developers an 
easy way to construct a GUI for their program. Through the use of Teuchos ParameterLists,
the TivaBuena package will allow the developer to achieve the following
workflow within their program:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Specify a list of inputs needed from the user
	\item Define valid values for inputs as well as defaults
	\item Present the required inputs to the user in the form of a GUI
	\item Allow the user to change the values of the inputs to their liking
	\item Obtain the values the user entered in the form of a Parameter List.
	\end{enumerate}
