/** \brief Abstract interface class for a basic communication channel between
 * one or more processes.
 *
 * This interface is templated on the ordinal type but only deals with buffers
 * of untyped data represented as arrays <tt>char</tt> type. All reduction
 * operations that are initiated by the concreate communicator object are
 * performed by user-defined <tt>ReductOpBase</tt> objects.  It is the
 * responsibility of the <tt>ReductOpBase</tt> object to know what the currect
 * data type is, to perform casts or serializations/unserializations to and
 * from <tt>char[]</tt> buffers, and to know how to reduce the objects
 * correctly.  It is strictly up to the client to correctly convert data types
 * to <tt>char[]</tt> arrays but there is a great deal of helper code to make
 * this easy and safe.
 *
 * ToDo: Finish documentation!
