  /// PerformanceMonitorBase is templated on a counter type T (which
  /// might be a timer or a flop counter). The common capability of the
  /// counter type is a counter for the number of calls.  Derived counter
  /// types may supply additional features.
  ///
  /// A PerformanceMonitorBase will increment its call counter upon every
  /// constructor call. Derived types might do more upon construction or
  /// destruction; for example, a timer will start upon construction and
  /// stop upon destruction.
  ///
  /// The class keeps a static list of all counters created using
  /// the \c getNewCounter() method during the course of a run. Counts
  /// from this list can then be printed out at the end of the run. 
  ///
  /// PerformanceMonitorBase requires that the counter type T provide at
  /// least the following interface:
  ///
  /// \code
  /// // Constructor taking an std::string argument (the counter name).
  /// T (const std::string&);
  ///
  /// // Return the name of the counter.
  /// const std::string& name () const;
  /// 
  /// // Add one to the number of calls (the number of times the counter
  /// // was started).
  /// void incrementNumCalls ();
  ///
  /// // Return the number of calls (see incrementNumCalls () above).
  /// int numCalls () const;
