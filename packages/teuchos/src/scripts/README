The Python scripts (.py) in this directory are for automatic code
generation.  The scripts are meant only for Trilinos developers, to
automate the process of writing code for certain tedious tasks (e.g.,
specializing a traits class for many different built-in C++ types).
The C++ files (.hpp and .cpp) in this directory are not meant to be
built or used as header files; they are only for use by the Python
scripts.  They provide string templates for the scripts to copy.

The Python scripts do not typically run as part of the normal build
process.  Trilinos developers execute the scripts manually to generate
code, and then check the resulting code into the source repository.
This appears to be common practice among different Trilinos packages.

The scripts in this directory are subject to the same open-source
license as the Teuchos package.  Please refer to teuchos/Copyright.txt
for license details.  Interested users are welcome to examine the
scripts in this directory, subject to the terms of this license.
