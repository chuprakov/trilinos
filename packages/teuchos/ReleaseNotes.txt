Release Notes for Trilinos Package Teuchos
------------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.2:
--------------


(*) Default debug enable of RCP node tracing: Setting Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON
now sets Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG_RCP_NODE_TRACING=ON by default.  This is a more
strict type of checking that will catch more errors.


(*) Known breaks in backward compatibility:

- The type Teuchos_Ordinal has been changed from int to ptrdiff_t by default.
On 64 bit machines, this will be 'long int' instead of 'int'.  This can be
changed back to int by configuring with -DTeuchos_ORDINAL_TYPE:STRING=int.

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::Array has been changed from size_t to
Teuchos_Ordinal which is now ptrdiff_t, a signed integer which is *not* int on
a 64 bit platform.  See the argument for this in Bugzilla bug 4253.

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::ArrayView and Teuchos::ArrayRCP has also
been changed to Teuchos_Ordinal to be consistent with Teuchos::Array.

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::Range1D has been changed to
Teuchos_Ordinal.

- Removed Teuchos_exit.h with the TEUCHOS_EXIT(...) macros.  These were a bad
idea and where never used in Trilinos.  Hopefully no external Trilinos user
made use of these either.

- Non-member functions related to RCPNode tracing have been collected into a
new static class Teuchos::RCPNodeTracer.  Given that no user code should ever
be calling these functions in production code this should not affect most
users.


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------


(*) Known breaks in backward compatibility:

- The raw pointer T* argument in Teuchos::set_extra_data(...) has been
changed to Teuchos::Ptr<T>&.  This requires that you replace:

    Teuchos::set_extra_data(data, dataName, &rcpObj);

with:

    Teuchos::set_extra_data(data, dataName, Teuchos::outArg(rcpObj));
