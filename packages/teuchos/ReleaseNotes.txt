Release Notes for Trilinos Package Teuchos
------------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------


(*) Known breaks in backward compatibility:

- The raw pointer T* argument in Teuchos::set_extra_data(...) has been
changed to Teuchos::Ptr<T>&.  This requires that you replace:

    Teuchos::set_extra_data(data, dataName, &rcpObj);

with:

    Teuchos::set_extra_data(data, dataName, Teuchos::outArg(rcpObj));


Trilinos 10.2:
--------------

(*) Known breaks in backward compatibility:

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::Array has been changed from size_t to
Teuchos_Ordinal which is now ptrdiff_t, a signed integer which is *not* int on
a 64 bit platform.  See the argument for this in Bugzilla bug 4253.

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::ArrayView and Teuchos::ArrayRCP has also
been changed to Teuchos_Ordinal to be consistent with Teuchos::Array.

- The size_type typedef in Teuchos::Range1D has been changed to
Teuchos_Ordinal.
