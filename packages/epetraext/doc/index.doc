\section EpetraExt_intro Introduction
EpetraExt is a set of extensions to Epetra.  To allow Epetra to remain
focused on it's primary functionality as a Linear Algebra object support,
EpetraExt was created to maintain additional support for such capabilities
as transformations (permutions, sub-block views, etc.), coloring support,
partitioning (Zoltan), and I/O.

\section EpetraExt_startup Overview of EpetraExt.

\subsection EpetraExt_formulations EpetraExt Classes

EpetraExt contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

<ul> 

<li> EpetraExt::Transform classes: These classes derive from EpetraExt::Transform allowing a common
     interface for transformation of epetra objects and migration of associated 
     data.

<ol>

<li> EpetraExt::Transform: Abstract base for transformation of object of type T
     to object of type U.


<li> EpetraExt::Transform_Composite: Allows the additive composition of 
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform's.

<li> Convertors: EpetraExt::LinearProblem_GraphTrans and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_MatrixTrans
     converts a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsGraph> and
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsMatrix> to a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_LinearProblem>

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Overlap: Forms the overlapped version of a distributed graph
     up to the user specified level.

<li> Reindexer's: Used to remap the global indexing of an existing Epetra object include
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_Reindex, EpetraExt::MultiVector_Reindex, and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Reindex.

<li> EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Scale: Linear left and right scaling of a Epetra_LinearProblem

<li> Solver Mapping Tools: Remaps the columns of a CrsGraph or LinearProblem to meet the
     requirements of a square local block indexing for some linear solvers. Tools are
     EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SolverMap and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_SolverMap.

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SymmRCM: Perform a symmetric RCM for the local blocks of a
     Epetra_CrsGraph.

<li> Transpose: Form the explicit transpose of a Epetra_CrsGraph or Epetra_CrsMatrix.
     Tools are EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Transpose and EpetraExt::RowMatrix_Transpose.

<li> View: For sub-block views of existing Epetra objects including EpetraExt::CrsGraph_View,
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_View and EpetraExt::MultiVector_View

<li> Permutation: EpetraExt::Permutation is used for simple permutations of Epetra_CrsGraph,
     Epetra_CrsMatrix, and Epetra_MultiVector given a new Epetra_Map object.

</ol>

</ul>

\subsection EpetraExt_functions EpetraExt Functions

<ul>

<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMatrix: Static Matrix Matrix Operations including Multiply and Add.

<li> InOut: I/O operations for Epetra objects based on 
<ol>
<li> Matlab triplet (i,j,value) format for writing and reading of Epetra RowMatrix and Operator objects.
<li> Matrix Market format: Support writing and reading of Epetra BlockMap, Map, MultiVector, Vector, RowMatrix and
Operator objects.
<li> HDF5 format: Support writing and reading of Epetra BlockMap, Map, MultiVector, Vector, RowMatrix and
Operator objects.  Available when EpetraExt is configured with \c --enable-epetraext-hdf5. 
<li> An XML-compatible reader and writer is available when Teuchos is configures with --enable-teuchos-expat.
</ol>

The simplest of the input function is EpetraExt::MatlabFileToCrsMatrix.  This function requires only a valid ASCII
file containing 1 or more lines where each row is of the form: (row_index, col_index, value) and a valid Epetra_Comm
object.  The matrix domain and range maps are assumed to have a size of the maximum row and column index present
in the file, respectively, and will be constructed as uniform distributed maps.  The row map will be identical to the
range map and the column map will be determined by which columns are present for the rows on a given processor.

The simplest output functions are EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile and EpetraExt:OperatorToMatlabFile, which write out
any Epetra_RowMatrix or Epetra_Operator object, respectively.  Epetra_Operator coefficients are generated by multiplying
the operator with the canonical vectors, several at a time for performance reasons.

The I/O function are summarized below:

<ol>
<li> BlockMap and Map I/O:
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToBlockMap
<li> EpetraExt::BlockMapToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToMap
</ol>
<li> CrsMatrix Input:
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::MatlabFileToCrsMatrix
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToCrsMatrix
</ol>
<li> RowMatrix output (includes all Epetra matrix classes):
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile

<li> Operator output (includes all Epetra matrix and operator classes):
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile
</ol>
<li> MultiVector and Vector I/O:
<li> MultiVector and Vector I/O:
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToMultiVector
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToVector
<li> EpetraExt::MultiVectorToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::VectorToMatrixMarketFile
</ol>
<li> HDF5 class: EpetraExt::HDF5
<li> XML classes: EpetraExt::XMLReader and EpetraExt::XMLWriter.
</ol>

The following example (from Trilinos/packages/aztecoo/example/AztecOO_Matlab_Input) shows an interesting 
use of these classes, illustrating how to use these classes in conjunction with
AztecOO to write out the coefficients of the inverse of a matrix:

\verbinclude cxx_main.cpp


<li> Coloring: Helper tools for generating Finite Differencing Colorings of Linear Problems.

<li> Zoltan Tools: Primarily tools for generation of repartitioned Epetra objects using
     the Zoltan library.
     
<li> Matlab: Communication interface between Epetra and Matlab.  Exports Epetra objects to Matlab and imports objects from Matlab.
     Sends user specified Matlab commands to the Matlab engine to modify the Matlab workspace which provides user interaction with the Matlab engine.

<li> Nonlinear Model Evaluator: <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt> provides an
Epetra-specific interface to nonlinear models for use by equation solvers all the
way up to optimization.

</ul>

\section EpetraExt_adapters EpetraExt adapters

The EpetraExt pacakge can also optionally support adapters to various
interfaces.  Support for these adapters can be turned on at configure time.

<ul>

<li> <a href="../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">EpetraExt/Thyra
Adapters</a>: These adapters implement various advanced %Thyra interfaces in
terms of %EpetraExt code.

</ul>

\section EpetraExt_browser Browse all of Epetraext as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of EpetraExt as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about EpetraExt software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of epetraext</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
