Creation of a MAC OS X application for PyTrilinos
=================================================

This file explains how to create a self-contained PyTrilinos application for
MAC OS X 10.4. Working assumptions:

*) MAC OS X 10.4 (Tiger) is used. I guess the same procedure could work for
   another version, but it has not been tested. The resulting application
   is tightly bound to the version used for creation, tough.

*) py2app (http://undefined.org/python/py2app.html) has been installed by
   downloading the sources of the application, available at the web page.
   (FIXME: version 0.2 requires small fix, namely the creation of a doc
    directory.) 

*) python 2.3.5, distributed with OS X 10.4, is used.

*) Trilinos has been configured with the script located in
   Trilinos/sampleScripts/macosx_serial_marzio, which basically enables all
   packages till ML. (FIXME: NOX has to be supported as well.) 
  
*) The compilers are GNU for C/C++ and F77, no other external libraries 
   are used. 


The steps to be followed are:

1) Configure, compile and install Trilinos:

$ cd ~/Trilinos
$ mkdir SERIAL_MPI
$ cd SERIAL_MPI
$ ../sampleScripts/macosx_serial_marzio 
$ make
$ make install

2) Jump into this directory and run setup.py:

$ cd ~/Trilinos/packages/PyTrilinos/macdist
$ python setup.py py2app

3) Now you have (in principle) all files required to run PyTrilinos in
   ~/Trilinos/packages/PyTrilinos/macdist/dist. PyTrilinos scripts can be
   executed in the following way:

$ cd ~/Trilinos/packages/PyTrilinos/macdist/
$ ./dist/Trilinos.app/Contents/MacOS/Trilinos my-script.py 

4) To create the tarball, simply do:

$ tar cvfz Trilinos.tgz dist/Trilinos.app

5) Cross your fingers, this *should* work on all MAC OS X!
