* Builds in standalone (non-sierra) mode.  All tests pass

* Building in sierra mode with "-D
  Trios_ENABLE_USE_WITH_SIERRA:BOOL=TRUE" works except for linking the
  executables.  There is an issue that the Boost programs_options is
  in a library, where most of the other Boost usages is header only.

* C API for both nemesis and exodus installed; need to also install
  Fortran API.  Currently waiting for minor refactoring of how the
  fortran libraries are built in SEAMS.

* Need to activate the exodus "old tests".

* Add more tests

* Better handling of xdmf
