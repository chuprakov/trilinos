\section rcb_algorithm RCB algorithm

Recursive coordinate bisection (RCB) is a parallel geometric partitioning algorithm.  Geometric coordinates are partitioned into two balanced parts.  Partitioning continues recursively in each part until the desired number of balanced parts has been created.


\subsection rcb_input Input

RCB expects a Zoltan2::CoordinateInput object.  This class supports geometric coordinates of arbitrary dimension, with weights of arbritrary dimension.  If weights are not provided, RCB assumes coordinates are equally weighted.

\subsection rcb_parameters Parameters

\subsection rcb_solution Solution

An RCB solution is a list of global IDs with a corresponding list of part numbers and process ranks.  

\subsection rcb_quality_measures Quality measures

RCB quality is measured with an imbalance measure.
