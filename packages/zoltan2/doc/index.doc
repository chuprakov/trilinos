\section zoltan2_intro Introduction to Zoltan2

This document is a work in progress.

\section zoltan2_startup Overview of Zoltan2

The workflow for a Zoltan2 problem is illustrated below:

\image html algorithmWorkflow.png 

A Zoltan algorithm is presented with an objective, for example partitioning objects in order
to balance a workload.  In addition, algorithm parameters 
and a candidate solution may provided.
The algorithm calculates a solution for the objective.  The Objective and the Result correspond
to classes in Zoltan2, and the algorithms are the Zoltan methods.

\code
void rcb(Objective<Scalar, LNO, GNO, AppGID> &o, Teuchos::ParameterList &p, Result<LNO, GNO> &r)
\endcode

\section zoltan2_classes Zoltan 2 classes

These diagrams were created with plantUML.  Each class is templated, but I wasn't able to show that with plantUML.

\subsection zoltan2_objectid The ObjectID class

\subsection zoltan2_objectsource The ObjectSource class

\subsection zoltan2_objective The Objective class

\subsection zoltan2_result The Result class

\section zoltan2_evaluation Evaluating the quality of a Zoltan result

The workflow for evaluating a result for an objective is illustrated here:

\code
void evaluate(Objective<Scalar, LNO, GNO, AppGID> &o, Result<LNO, GNO> &r)
\endcode
