\section zoltan2_intro Introduction to Zoltan2

Zoltan2 is a refactoring of the

library into C++ in order to support template programming,
to scale to larger problems, and to support architecture aware partitioning.
This library is currently under active development, and is still 
in pre-copyright status.  

Partitioning functionality that is available now is:

<ul>
<li> Recursive coordinate bisection (RCB) of weighted geometric coordinates.
<li> Block partitioning of weighted objects.
<li> Graph partitioning of undirected weighted graphs through an interface to PTScotch.
</ul>


Serial ordering available now is:

<ul>
<li> RCM
<li> AMD
<li> Increasing degree
<li> Natural (identity permutation)
<li> Random
</ul>
