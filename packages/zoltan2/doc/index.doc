\section zoltan2_startup Overview of Zoltan2

The workflow for a Zoltan2 problem is illustrated below:

A Zoltan algorithm is presented with an objective, for example partitioning objects in order
to balance a workload or coloring the vertices of a graph.  In addition, algorithm parameters 
and a candidate solution may provided.
The algorithm calculates a solution for the objective.  These inputs and output correspond
to classes in Zoltan2, and the algorithms are the Zoltan methods.
