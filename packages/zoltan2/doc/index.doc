\section zoltan2_intro Introduction to Zoltan2

This document is a work in progress.

\section zoltan2_startup Overview of Zoltan2

\section zoltan2_classes Zoltan 2 classes

These diagrams were created with plantUML. 

\subsection zoltan2_idmap The IdentifierMap class

I was calling this the ObjectID class, but we want to get away from the use of the word "object" to describe the elements being partitionex by Zoltan.  This would replace the functionality of the Zoltan_DD_* utility.

\subsection zoltan2_adapter The InputAdapter class

I was calling this the ObjectSource class, but InputAdapter is much better.

\subsection zoltan2_objective The Objective class

As before.

\subsection zoltan2_mapping The Mapping class

The central object in the system.  It encapsulates the graph (etc) with an initial partitioning (etc.) and objective, and a mapping to a new partitioning (etc).
