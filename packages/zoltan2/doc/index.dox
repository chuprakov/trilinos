\section z2_main_intro Introduction to Zoltan2

Zoltan2 is a refactoring of the <a href=http://www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan >
Zoltan </a>
library into C++ in order to support template programming,
to scale to larger problems, and to support architecture aware partitioning.
This library is currently under active development, and is still 
in pre-copyright status.  

Partitioning functionality that is available now is:

<ul>
<li> \ref blockPage for simple weighted identifiers.
<li> \ref rcbPage for weighted geometric coordinates.
<li> \ref scotchPartPage for undirected weighted graphs.
</ul>


Serial ordering available now is:

<ul>
<li> \ref rcmPage for RCM ordering.
<li> \ref amdPage for AMD ordering.
<li> Increasing degree
<li> Natural (identity permutation)
<li> Random
</ul>

\section z2_main_overview Overview of the Zoltan2 library

\subsection Typical steps

Here we describe the typical user interaction with Zoltan2.  We use partitioning as an example.

1. Create a Zoltan2::InputAdapter object for your data.  This adapter provides a uniform interface to user data for the Zoltan2 library.  Adapter interfaces exist for the following classes of data:

<ul>
<li> Zoltan2::MatrixInput (a row oriented matrix with optional row weights)
<li> Zoltan2::GraphInput (an undirected weighted graph)
<li> Zoltan2::VectorInput (a single or multi-vector with optional weights)
<li> Zoltan2::CoordinateInput (arbitrary-dimension geometric coordinates)
<li> Zoltan2::IdentifierInput (simple collection of identifiers)
</ul>

Zoltan2::MeshInput will be available soon.

2. Create a Teuchos::ParameterList with your Zoltan2 parameters.  If you are using a third party library (PT-Scotch, ParMetis) you can include a sublist of parameters for this library.  Parameters are listed here. (TODO - generate doxygen list from xml file of parameters.)

3. Create a Zoltan2::PartitioningProblem.  It is templated on your Zoltan2::InputAdapter type.  The constructor arguments are your input adapter and your parameter list.

4. Call Zoltan2::PartitioningProblem::solve().

5. Obtain a Zoltan2::PartitioningSolution object from the Zoltan2::PartitioningProblem.

\section z2_main_examples Examples of Zoltan2 usage

Examples include the following:

- Block partitioning (block.cpp)
- RCB partitioning for a C++ novice (rcb_C.cpp)
