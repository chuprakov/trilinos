Release notes for Trilinos v11.8.

Simplified input Adapter classes for easier implementation by applications.
(This change may break backward compatibility for some users.)

Added ability to associate coordinates with matrix rows and graph vertices
through the MatrixAdapter and GraphAdapter.

Improved the performance and readability of Multijagged Partitioning.
Some parameter names have changed or have been deleted:
        pqParts --> mj_parts
        parallel_part_calculation_count --> mj_concurrent_part_count
        migration_check_option --> mj_migration_option
        migration_imbalance_cut_off --> mj_minimum_migration_imbalance
        keep_part_boxes --> mj_keep_part_boxes
        recursion_depth --> mj_recursion_depth
        migration_processor_assignment_type deleted.
        migration_all_to_all_type deleted.
        migration_doMigration_type deleted.


Added weights to graph partitioning via Scotch.

Changed weight specifications in input Adapters; users can no longer provide
NULL weight arrays for uniform weights.

Added more robuts testing.

Fixed several bugs.

----------------------------------


Trilinos v11 is the initial release of Zoltan2.  Zoltan2 is a redesign of the
Zoltan combinatorial scientific computing toolkit that uses templating and
Trilinos classes for tighter integration with Trilinos.  Zoltan2 supports
Epetra and Tpetra data structures through the Xpetra interface.

Capabilities that are supported by default in Zoltan2:
   Minimum-degree data ordering using the AMD TPL
   Reverse Cuthill-McKee data ordering
   Graph partitioning using the Scotch TPL
   Block partitioning

Experimental capabilities are supported only if the following CMake option 
is used; these capabilities are under development.
  -D Zoltan2_ENABLE_Experimental:BOOL=ON

Experimental capabilities include:
   Recursive Coordinate Bisection geometric partitioning
   Multidimensional-Jagged geometric partitioning
   Spectral data ordering
   Increasing degree data ordering
   Natural data ordering
   Random data ordering
