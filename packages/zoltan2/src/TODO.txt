        read them in.

    TODO: This class does not support Zoltan1's global ID as is an arbitrary number

       TODO: we should be able to do partitioning without having global

    TODO: Enhance methods so they can use the result even if refinement of
      a mesh has occured since the result was computed.
  


For the Objective:
 (TODO: Should we create a Constraints class to
  represent constraints like this?)  It could also have a Result to
  refine rather than starting from scratch.
