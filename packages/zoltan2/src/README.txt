We're working out the class design for Zoltan2 in these files.  They
are most likely not compilable at this point in time.  The doxygen
comments are correct.

In the doc directory you can "doxygen Doxyfile" and generate html documentation.  
If you have the "dot" utility from graphviz in your path, doxygen will generate
class diagrams.  (You have to set HAVE_DOT to "yes" in zoltan/doc/Doxyfile.)

Also, we have a trac site with more design documentation.
