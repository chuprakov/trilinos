\chapter{Some Useful Mesquite Wrappers}
\label{sec:useful_wrappers}

This chapter provides a summary of the current Mesquite wrappers, along
with demonstrations of their utility. Applications which desire to access
Mesquite capabilities without delving into the low-level API can invoke 
wrappers to perform basic mesh quality improvement tasks that, except for
a few user-defined inputs, are fully automatic. 

\section{The Shape-Improvement Wrapper} \label{sec:ShapeImprovementWrapper}
This wrapper seeks to improve the {\it shape} of mesh elements based on 
an ideal element shape which is determined by the element type. For example,
triangular elements are assumed to have an ideal shape corresponding to 
an equilateral triangle, quadrilaterals to a square, tetrahedral to an
equilateral tetrahedron, hexahedra to a cube, wedges to XXX, and pyramids 
to YYY. If a more general shape is desired, please consider using the XXX
smoother. The initial mesh is required to be non-inverted since the 
shape-metric has a barrier. The metric is based on the Inverse Mean Ratio.
