How to build the Mesquite Users Guide (on Unix/Linux)

1. cd to the mesquite top level directory (the one 
      that contains all the makefiles)

2. Enter the following commands:

     ./mkconfigure
     ./configure
     cd doc/user
     make pdf
 
  Note: "make pdf" will build both a .pdf and postscript (.ps)
     version of the guide.

3. To build only a postscript version:

     make ps
