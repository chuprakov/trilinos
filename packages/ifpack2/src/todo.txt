*** Internal to Ifpack2 ***

* Add Overlap / AdditiveSchwarz capability 
* Reordering (e.g. RCM), two ways
  - implicitly for ILUs (as the matrix is being copied into the factors)
  - explicitly returning a reordering vector (for the application to do itself)
* Block Relaxation & Chebyshev 
* Filtering
* Less popular methods - IHSS, SORa
* Add templated operator methods to all Preconditioners (for multiprecision)
  - add applyPrec<OpScalar> method to precs, which operates on MV<OpScalar> objects
  - call this from apply()
  - do this for all other operators 


*** Requires Discussion w/ Other Package Devs ***

* Partitioners - Zoltan2
* Move to Xpetra?
* Kokkos kernels?
* Ifpack2 / ShyLU / MueLu relationships & interfaces
* Ifpack2 hash table (should use the one in Teuchos?)
* TPL support - HIPS, SuperLU(ILU), Euclid, Hypre, Sparskit) - Where does
  this belong?
