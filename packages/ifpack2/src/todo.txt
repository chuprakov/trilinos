*** Internal to Ifpack2 ***

* Add Overlap / AdditiveSchwarz capability 
* Reordering (e.g. RCM), two ways
  - implicitly for ILUs (as the matrix is being copied into the factors)
  - explicitly returning a reordering vector (for the application to do itself)
 Reordering routines are to be accessed through Zoltan2, which
  Ifpack2 will call. 
* Block Relaxation & Chebyshev 
* Filtering
* Less popular methods - IHSS, SORa
* Add templated operator methods to all Preconditioners (for multiprecision)
  - add applyPrec<OpScalar> method to precs, which operates on MV<OpScalar> objects
  - call this from apply()
  - do this for all other operators 
* Local Partitioners (except for the linear one) are to live in
  Zoltan2, which Ifpack2 will call.
* Ifpack2's hash table will be removed and it will depend of Teuchos' 
  hash table instead, once Teuchos' hash table is improved.
* TPL routines (e.g. HIPS, SuperLU(ILU), Euclid, Hypre, Sparskit) will
  be accessed via an interface to Amesos2.
* Fix the Ifpack2 Parameter Validation
  - Allow for templates
  - Fix organization

*** Requires Discussion w/ Other Package Devs ***
* Move to Xpetra?
* Kokkos kernels?
