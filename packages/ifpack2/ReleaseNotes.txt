Trilinos 11.6:
--------------

* AdditiveSchwarz interface changes

AdditiveSchwarz implements additive Schwarz domain decomposition.
The class also manages and invokes the solver for each subdomain.
That solver must implement Ifpack2::Preconditioner.

We made two changes to AdditiveSchwarz:

  1. Subdomain solver type is now determined entirely at run time
  2. Second template parameter (LocalInverseType) is deprecated

These changes are related to each other.  It used to be that users
would specify the type of the subdomain solver as the second template
parameter of AdditiveSchwarz, LocalInverseType.  The value of
LocalInverseType had to be a concrete subclass of Preconditioner.
This is no longer the case.  Users now may and should omit
AdditiveSchwarz's second template parameter.  More importantly, they
may now specify the subdomain solver's type at run time.  They may do
so either as a run-time parameter in the input ParameterList of
AdditiveSchwarz, or by calling AdditiveSchwarz's
setInnerPreconditioner() method.  See AdditiveSchwarz's public class
documentation for details.

AdditiveSchwarz's second template parameter has a default value of
Ifpack2::Preconditioner.  For backwards compatibility, if users
specify a known concrete subclass of Ifpack2::Preconditioner for
LocalInverseType, AdditiveSchwarz will implement the previous behavior
of creating a subdomain solver of that specific type.  In the next
major Trilinos release, we plan to remove AdditiveSchwarz's second
template parameter entirely.

Trilinos 11.4:
--------------

* Relaxation: Use precomputed offsets to extract diagonal

As of this release, Tpetra::CrsMatrix has the ability to to precompute
offsets of diagonal entries, and use them to accelerate extracting a
copy of the diagonal. Relaxation now exploits this feature to speed up
compute() (which extracts a copy of the diagonal of the input matrix).
The optimization only occurs if the input matrix is a CrsMatrix (not
just a RowMatrix) and if it has a const ("static") graph. The latter
is necessary so that we know that the structure can't change between
calls to compute(). (Otherwise we would have to recompute the offsets
each time, which would be no more efficient than what it was doing
before.)
