Thyra : Release Notes for Trilinos 9.0

================================================================================

(*) Added new templated Thyra::DefaultSerialDenseLinearOp[WithSolve]Factory
subclasses to allow use of LAPACK for solving linear systems using
Thyra::MultiVector objects as input.  This was mostly just to allow for
better, more independent unit tests.

(*) Some refactorings to replace raw C++ pointers with safe Teuchos memory
management classes (but a lot of work still needs to be done here)

(*) Removed the SUNDIALS RTOp wrappers since they no longer exist in RTOp

(*) Changed from Thyra::ETransp to Thyra::EOpTransp to avoid doxygen
conflicts with Teuchos::ETransp.  A backward-compatible typedef to
Thyra::ETransp still exists to not break existing external code.

With few exceptions, all changes should be backward compatible (search for
"deprecated" comments).
