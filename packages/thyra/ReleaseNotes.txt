Release Notes for Trilinos Package Thyra
----------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------


(*) MS Windows support with MS Visual C++:

- Thyra complex support and float support are disabled by default.
The complex-related code just did not work correctly and there was not
time to track down the problem.

- Several of the tests showed excessive diffs for this platform so their
tolerance was loosened.


(*) Partial refactoring of code to use safe memory management classes
