\section belos_browser Browse all of Belos as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Belos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Belos software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of belos</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.

\section belos_thyra Thyra support

The <a href="../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">Belos to Thyra Linear Solver
Adapters</a> take <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> objects and turn them into
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects which can then be used to solve
linear systems using %Belos linear solvers implementations.
