Welcome to Isorropia, a package for partitioning and load-balancing
in the Trilinos framework! Please note this package is NOT related to
the thermodynamics code from Georgia Tech.

Several example programs reside in the example subdirectory, to
demonstrate using Isorropia to partition and rebalance Epetra objects.

Isorropia was refactored for version 3.0 (Trilinos 9.0), and now depends
on Zoltan and Epetra. There are several new features, including coloring
and ordering. Please see the release notes for details.

For documentation, see our website:

===================
List of Isorropia Parameters:
-----------------------------

FOO:
     *DEFAULT*		  Default for parameter FOO
     NOT DEFAULT          Other meaningful value for parameter FOO
     ANOTHER NOT DEFAULT  another value for FOO



STRUCTURALLY SYMMETRIC:
     *NO*                 Implies that all the graph algorithms will
			  symmetrize the graph first.
     YES		  No symmetrization needed.


Partitioning parameters:
------------------------

PARTITIONING METHOD:      Related to Zoltan LB_METHOD parameter.
     *RCB*		  Default when geometry is provided.
     HSCF                 Available when geometry is provided.
     GRAPH                Use a graph partitioner
     *HYPERGRAPH*         Use an hypergraph partitioner, default.

NUM PARTS:
     number               Global number of parts wanted.
			  Default is the number of processes.

IMBALANCE TOL:
     number               Imbalance allowed during partitioning.

BALANCE OBJECTIVE:
     *ROWS*		  By default, we balance rows of the matrix.
     NONZEROS		  Balance nonzeros of the matrix.


Coloring parameters:
--------------------

DISTANCE:
     number               Distance of the coloring problem, default is 2.
			  1 and 2 are the only valid values.
