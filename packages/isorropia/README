Welcome to Isorropia, a package for partitioning and load-balancing
in the Trilinos framework! Please note this package is NOT related to
the thermodynamics code from Georgia Tech.

Several example programs reside in the example subdirectory, to
demonstrate using Isorropia to partition and rebalance Epetra objects.

Isorropia was refactored for version 3.0 (Trilinos 9.0), and now depends
on Zoltan and Epetra. There are several new features, including coloring 
and ordering. Please see the release notes for details.
