Release notes for Isorropia 3.2 (Trilinos 10.0), Sept. 2009:

General:
 - Isorropia now has a set of parameters for common options,
   such that many users do not need to use Zoltan parameters. 
 - Zoltan parameters can still be set in a sublist.

Partitioning:
 - Added support for geometric partitioning via Epetra_MultiVector.
 - Added support for variable target part sizes. 
 - createBalancedCopy replaces create_balanced_copy and uses raw pointers
   instead of RCP.

Coloring:
 - Distance-2 coloring for Jacobians is now the default.
 - New methods Isorropia::Epetra::Colorer::generateRowMapColoring 
   and Isorropia::Epetra::Colorer::generateColMapColoring.
