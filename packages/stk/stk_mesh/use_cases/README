The use_cases serve as examples of creating and filling simple meshes.
The file UseCaseMain.cpp acts as a driver, running each of the separate use-cases
in succession.
Each use-case mesh is embodied in a struct or class called UseCase_<n>_Mesh.
The files for those classes contain the code that populates the MetaData and
BulkData mesh objects with mesh-entities, fields, etc.
UseCaseMain.cpp creates the UseCase_<n>_Mesh object, then calls functions
'populate' and 'verifyMesh'.


For a completely different example of using stk::mesh, see the
Mantevo 'miniFE' application, which is a miniature finite-element application.
miniFE can be downloaded from http://software.sandia.gov/mantevo.
After unpacking the miniFE source code, see the file stk_mesh_description.hpp.
miniFE builds a mesh representing a brick-shaped domain of hexahedral elements,
defines a coordinate field on the nodes, and assembles a finite-element
problem, solving the steady-state conduction equation.
