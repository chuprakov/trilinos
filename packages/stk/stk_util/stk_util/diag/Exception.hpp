// (Jun 2014) This file is retained for backwards compatability issues with User Subroutines.
// The contents of this file have been moved to utility/Slib_Exception.h, but there are/may be

// After a reasonable time, this file should have a #error added which tells users who

//
// After still longer, this file should be removed altogether.
