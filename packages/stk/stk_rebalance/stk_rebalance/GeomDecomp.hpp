/** @file GeomDecomp.h
 * @brief Geometric support for partitioning of mesh objects.
 *
 * This file contains a single class GeomDecomp derived from
 * the Partition class.  GeomDecomp adds geometric computations
 * to be used in determining an optimal distribution of mesh
 * objects.  GeomDecomp defines some virtual functions that
 * are to be specialized by the class that actually determines
 * the optimal distribution.
 *
 * Presently, only the support class for Zoltan,
 * specializes the GeomDecomp class.  If another optimal
 * distribution method is to be implemented, it should
 * be based on the GeomDecomp class.  This will enable application
 * codes to include just the GeomDecomp base class without
 * having specialized knowledge of the derived classes.
