The multidimensional array support is temporarily housed here until it
is moved into either Teuchos or its own package.  This should happen
before Trilinos release 10.0

- version_1 is the original MDArray where the Array was templated on a
DimNatural/DimFortran object that had all dimensioning.

- version_2 is the current incarnation in phdmesh.  It removed the
nested template by merging the DimNatural and DimFortran objects into
the Array itself.
