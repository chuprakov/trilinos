RTOp : Release Notes for Trilinos 9.0

================================================================================

Major refactoring of all code.

(*) All interfaces in rtop/src/interfaces are now "memory safe" using Teuchos
memory management classes

(*) Support code in rtop/src/support has been significantly changed to remove
duplication and bloat, provide for memory safely, and make it infinitely easier
to create simple RTOp subclasses.

(*) All of the concrete RTOp classes in rtop/src/ops_lib have been updated.
All of the simpler RTOps now use a simple set of macros and provide good
examples for users on how to create their own RTOp classes.  This includes
very detailed unit tests for all of the code.

(*) Old MPI junk that was not needed anymore was removed.

(*) Removed SUNDIAL RTOp subclasses since these are not being used and there
was no unit tests for them.

With few exceptions, all changes should be backward compatible for clients of
the RTOpPack::RTOpT abstract interface (search for "deprecated" comments).
