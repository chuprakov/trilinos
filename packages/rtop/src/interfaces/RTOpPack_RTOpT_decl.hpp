{};


/** \brief Templated interface to vector reduction/transformation operators
 * {abstract}.
 *
 * The purpose of this base class is to allow users to specify
 * arbitrary reduction/transformation operations on vectors without
 * requiring the vectors to reveal their implementation details.  The
 * design is motivated partly by the "Visitor" patter (Gamma, 1995).
 *
 * This interface is designed to allow implementation of a distributed
 * parallel application without the explicit knowledge by the
 * application.
 *
 * In the following discussion, <tt>v[k]</tt>, <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>
 * and <tt>z</tt> are some abstract vector objects of dimension
 * <tt>n</tt>.  Users can define operators to perform reduction and/or
 * transformation operations.  Reduction operations applied over all
 * of the elements of a vector require communication between nodes in
 * a parallel environment but do not change any of the vectors
 * involved.  Transformation operations don't require communication
 * between nodes in a parallel environment.  The targets of a
 * transformation operation is a set of one or more vectors which are
 * mutated in some way.
 *
 * The idea is that the user may want to perform reduction
 * operations of the form:
 *
 \verbatim

 op(v[0]...v[*],z[0]...z[*]) -> reduct_obj
 \endverbatim
 *
 * where <tt>reduct_obj</tt> is a single object based on a reduction over
 * all the elements of the vector arguments, or transformation
 * operations of the form:
 *
 \verbatim

 op(v[0](i)...v[*](i),z[0](i)...z[*](i)) -> z[0](i)...z[*](i), for i = 0...n-1
 \endverbatim
 *
 * Operators can also be defined that perform reduction and
 * transformation operations.
 *
 * The tricky part though, is that the <tt>reduct_obj</tt> object of
 * the reduction operation may be more complex than a single scalar
 * value.  For instance, it could be a <tt>double</tt> and an
 * <tt>int</tt> pair such as in the reduction operation:
 *
 \verbatim

 min{ |x(i)|, i = 0...n-1 } -> [ x(j_min), j_min ]
 \endverbatim
 *
 * or it could perform several reductions at once and store
 * several scalar values such as in:
 *
 \verbatim

 min_max_sum{ x(i), i = 0...n-1 } -> [ x(j_min), j_min, x(j_max), j_max, x_sum ]
 \endverbatim
 *
 * Transformation operations are much simpler to think about and to
 * deal with.  Some off-the-wall examples of transformation operations
 * that this design will support are:
 *
 \verbatim

 max{ |x(i)|, |y(i)| } + |z(i)| -> z(i), for i = 0...n-1
 
 alpha * |z(i)| / x(i) -> z(i), for i = 0...n-1
 
 alpha * x(i) * y(i) + beta * z(i) -> z(i), for i = 0...n-1
 \endverbatim
 *
 * Reduction operations present the more difficult technical
 * challenge since they require information gathered from all of the
 * elements to arrive at the final result.  This design allows
 * operator classes to be defined that can simultaneously perform
 * reduction and transformation operations:
 *
 \verbatim

   op(v[0](i)...v[*](i),z[0](i)...z[*](i)) -> z[0](i)...z[*](i),reduct_obj
      , for i = 0...n-1
 \endverbatim
 *
 * This design is based on a few assumptions about the reduction and
 * transformation operations and vector implementations themselves.
 * First, we will assume that vectors are stored and manipulated as
 * chunks of sub-vectors (of dimension <tt>subDim</tt>) where each
 * sub-vector is sufficiently large.  This design supports dense
 * strided sub-vectors (see <tt>ConstSubVectorView</tt> and <tt>SubVectorView</tt>)
 * and is relatively flexible.
 *
 * It is strictly the responsibilities of the vector implementations
 * to determine how these operators are applied.  For instance, if we
 * are performing a transformation operation of the form:
 *
 \verbatim

 op( x(i), y(i), z(i) ) -> z(i), for i = 0...n-1
 \endverbatim
 *
 * where <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt> are distributed
 * parallel vectors, then we would assume that the elements would be
 * partitioned onto the various processors with the same local
 * elements stored on each processor so as not to require any
 * communication between processors.
