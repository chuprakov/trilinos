The code in this directory is stand-alone for now.  It explores the performance of 
two orderings of multivector data.  The first "V1", orders the data row-by-row, so
if a multivector had 10 vectors of length 1000, the first value of the second vector
would be next to the first value of the first vector.

The second ordering is "V2" which orders all elements of the first vector, followed
by all values of the second vector, etc.

The data sets can be obtained from software.sandia.gov:~mheroux/HB_files.  These
are Harwell-Boeing data sets, so you can get your own if you like.  Just list the
paths of these files in the "in" file and pipe it to standard input:

./tsploops < in
