\mainpage Trilinos/Kokkos: Core Kernels Package

\section kokkos_intro Introduction

%Kokkos provides two main capabilities for Trilinos. The first is an abstract
programming interface (API) for handling memory and specify work for
shared-memory parallel nodes (the %Kokkos Node API). The second is a collection
of local (non-distributed) distributed linear algebra classes and the kernels
needed to realized their functionality in parallel (the %Kokkos Linear Algebra kernels library).

%Kokkos is typically not used in applications, but instead as a significant
component in higher-level Trilinos packages, such as Tpetra. The functionality
contained here-in has been put in the %Kokkos package in order to facilitate
code re-use and ease experimentation for kernel researchers.

\section kokkos_startup Overview of Kokkos.

\subsection kokkos_formulations Kokkos Classes

%Kokkos contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

<ul> <li> %Kokkos Node API

  <ul><li> Nodes based on the Kokkos::CUDANodeMemoryModel: GPU nodes using the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">NVIDIA/CUDA</a> graphic processing units (GPUs)
     <ul><li>Kokkos::ThrustGPUNode provides parallel compute capability for  via the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/thrust/">Thrust library</a>.
     </ul>
  <li> Nodes based on the Kokkos::StandardNodeMemoryModel: Host-bound/CPU nodes using standard memory allocation.
     <ul><li>Kokkos::SerialNode: provides a simple node, where all kernels are executed in serial.
     <li>Kokkos::TBBNode: provides support for multi-core CPUs using <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/">Intel TBB</a> (requires third-party library TBB).
     <li>Kokkos::TPINode: provides support for multi-core CPUs using Pthreads, via the ThreadPool package (requires ThreadPool and Pthreads TPL).
     </ul>
  </ul>

<li> %Kokkos Linear Algebra Kernels Library

  <ul><li> Data structures:
  
    <ol><li> Kokkos::CrsMatrix, Kokkos::CrsGraph class:  Classes providing the
    storage structure for a row-oriented sparse matrix.
  
    <li> Kokkos::MultiVector class: A class providing the structure of a dense
    multivector. Here, as throughout most of Trilinos, a "multivector" refers to a
    collection of vectors, typically stored in a contiguous allocation of memory.
  
    </ol>
  
  <li> Arithmetic interfaces:
  
    <ol><li> Kokkos::DefaultArithmetic: Provides basic functionality for 
    perfoming arithmetic of multivectors.
  
    <li> Kokkos::DefaultSparseMultiply, Kokkos::DefaultSparseSolve: Provides basic functionality for 
    computing multiplication and solve of a sparse matrix against a multivector.
  
    </ol>
  
  </ul>

</ul>

\subsection tpetra_trilinos Trilinos and Kokkos

Kokkos can be used as a stand-alone package.  However, it also provides functionality for Tpetra and Tifpack.
