 * \class HostInternal
 * \brief Internal implementation of intraprocess parallelism on the host.
 *
 * Hardware model
 * ==============
 *
 * - The Host process is running within a NUMA multiprocessor environment.
 * - The hardware locality (hwloc) library defines a 'node' as a collection
 *   of processing units associated with a NUMA region.
 * - If the Host process is pinned to a particular NUMA node we assume
 *   that the threads of the Host process are also restricted to that node.
 *
 * Be aware that "node" here means "CPU processing units associated
 * with a NUMA affinity region," and does not have its traditional
 * high-performance computing hardware meaning.
