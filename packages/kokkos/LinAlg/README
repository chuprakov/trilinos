sparse_triangular_solve.py: Code generator IN PROGRESS for sequential
sparse triangular solve.  TODO: compressed sparse column (CSC) format
(for the transpose of compressed sparse row (CSR) matrices), routines
that conjugate all the matrix entries.  CSC format sparse triangular
solve will look much like the reference BLAS' triangular solve (in
that it will overwrite the input vector), except that it will only
pass over the sparse matrix once for all the right-hand sides.
