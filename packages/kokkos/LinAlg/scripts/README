* SparseTriSolve.py

Code generator for sequential sparse triangular solve.  This Python
script generates templated C++ code for many different variants of
sparse triangular solve for sparse matrices stored in compressed
sparse row (CSR) or compressed sparse column (CSC) format, and dense
input and output (multi)vectors stored in either column-major or
row-major layout.

The typical use case of the code is to generate two header files: one
of declarations, and the other of definitions.  To do this, just run
it as a script:

$ python SparseTriSolve.py

That will create the two header files in the current working
directory.  You can also import the SparseTriSolve module from Python
and use specific functions there.

* sparse_triangular_solve.py

Older version (DEPRECATED) of the above code generator.

TODO: 

* Wouldn't it be nice if we could write kernels in a Python-like
  pseudocode, and generate C++ code from them?  (We could use Python's
  ast module for that.)
