Currently (as of 2/16/2011) \muelu is not part of \trilinos proper.  It is instead managed as a separate project,
with its own git repository.  However, \muelu is intended to be built seamlessly with the \trilinos cmake
infrastructure.

\subsection{Configure and Build Instructions}

\be
  \item Checkout both \trilinos and \muelu.
  \item In the \trilinos root directory, make a symbolic link to the \muelu source directory.
  \item Configure \trilinos as usual, but with the additional cmake directives\\
    \begin{verbatim}
      -D Trilinos_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES="MueLu"
      -D Trilinos_ENABLE_MueLu:BOOL=ON
      -D MueLu_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON
      -D MueLu_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON
      -D MueLu_ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON
    \end{verbatim}
  \item Build \trilinos as usual.
  \item In your build directory, you should see the subdirectory \verb!MueLu!, which contains all the test and
  example executables.
