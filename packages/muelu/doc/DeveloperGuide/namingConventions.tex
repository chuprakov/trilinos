\subsection{Variable Names}

The general rule-of-thumb is to use ``CamelCase" where ever possible, with the first letter of the variable
lowercase.  This means that
the first letter of words are uppercase, and all other letters are lowercase.  Here are some examples:
\be
  \item \cc{levelId}
  \item \cc{smootherFunction}
\ee
%
Use underscores to denote a class's private variables.
\be
  \item \cc{numIterations\_}
  \item \cc{state\_}
\ee
%
An exception to this rule is naming matrices.  Matrices are uppercase.  Here are some examples:
\be
  \item \cc{A}
  \item \cc{APpattern}
  \item \cc{Pdata}
\ee

Please make names meaningful where possible.
