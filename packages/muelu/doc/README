MueLu's documentation can be built in either the source or build directories:

1) SOURCE DIRECTORY

   You do not need to run cmake.  In the *source* tree, simply do the following
   in the directory muelu/doc:

    a) setenv TRILINOS_HOME /absolute/path/to/your/Trilinos/source/dir
    b) doxygen Doxyfile

2) BUILD DIRECTORY

   a) setenv TRILINOS_HOME /absolute/path/to/your/Trilinos/source/dir
   b) Run your cmake configure line or script.
   c) In the *build* directory in the subdirectory muelu/doc,
      type "make doc".  The documentation will be placed in muelu/doc/html.


NOTES
----
1) Doxyfile.in is for cmake, Doxyfile is if you want to build the docs in the
   source tree.  Both of these files include the same file, "Doxyfile.options".

2) If you want better LaTeX rendering:
   a) Download MathJax.
   b) Use doxygen version 1.7.2 or later.
   c) Edit the MathJax lines appropriately in Doxyfile.options.
