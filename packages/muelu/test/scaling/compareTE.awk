# awk script to compare Epetra and Tpetra timings from MueLu_ScalingTest.exe side-by-side.
#
# syntax:
#    awk -f compareTE.awk file1 file2
#
# where file1 and file2 are epetra/tpetra screen dumps.  file1 and file2 can have any name you like, and order doesn't matter.
#
# You should see something like the following:
#                                                                                          Tpetra       Epetra    T/E ratio
