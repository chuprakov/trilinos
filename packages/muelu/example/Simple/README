The 'Simple' example collection presents several flavors of the same minimalistic example.

Examples presents the MueLu interface API. Examples also demonstrates:
- how to hide template parameters.
- how to interface MueLu with Epetra, Tpetra, Belos and AztecOO.

If you want to access MueLu through Stratimikos, see ParameterList/Stratimikos.cpp.
If you want to learn about available options to configure MueLu preconditioners, see NativeInterface/ or ParameterList/.
Examples are not using Galeri::Xpetra in a attempt to demonstrate how to use the linear algebra package interface.

Examples:
 Simple           - Create a matrix and solve Ax=b using default parameters of MueLu.
 Simple-LongInt   - Demontrates how to change default template parameters. In this example, GlobalOrdinal = long long int.
 Simple-Templated - In this version, template parameters are explicitly defined.

 Simple-Belos     - How to use MueLu as a preconditioner for Belos.
 Simple-Epetra    - How to use MueLu with existing Epetra code.
 Simple-Tpetra    - How to use MueLu with existing Tpetra code.
 
 Simple-AztecOO   - How to use MueLu as a preconditioner for AztecOO.

Usage:
 ./MueLu_Simple.exe

Dependencies:
 Examples are compiled only if they can be run with your current
 configuration of Trilinos.
 -
 The four first examples are using Tpetra+Ifpack2+Amesos2 when
 available and fall back on Epetra+Ifpack+Amesos when one of the three
 firstly cited packages is not available.

Notes:
 This examples are not using MueLu::Gallery in a attempt to demonstrate how to use the linear algebra package interface.
