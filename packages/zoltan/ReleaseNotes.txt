Release notes for Trilinos v11.

-  Zoltan is now released under Trilinos' BSD license.

-  The following features are no longer supported in Trilinos v11:
   +  Zoltan v1.1 interface (as described in Zoltan include file lbi_const.h): 
      users should upgrade their Zoltan interface and include file zoltan.h. 
      Instructions are at the Zoltan FAQ page.
   +  Partitioning method OCTPART: use partitioning method HSFC for similar 
      partitions with faster partitioning time.
   +  Use of DRUM as a Zoltan TPL: architecture-aware methods will be 
      included in Zoltan2. 

-  Improved memory usage in Zoltan Distributed Data Directories.  Memory is
   now managed in a single block, eliminating excessive calls to malloc and
   improving the runtime performance of the data directories and the
   hierarchical partitioning algorithms that use them.

-  Hierarchical partitioning received several performance, interface and 
   testing improvements.  In particular, an easier-to-use interface has been 
   added using simple parameters (HIER_ASSIST, PLATFORM_NAME, TOPOLOGY)
   instead of callback functions; the callback function interface is still
   supported.  Also, hierarchical partitioning can now be used with only
   geometric partitioners and callbacks, whereas before it required 
   graph-based callbacks as well.

-  Reduced the memory usage of RCB and RIB when parameter KEEP_CUTS=0.

-  Increased use of point-to-point communication (instead of MPI_Alltoall)
   in communication package for better performance on large number of 
   processors.

-  Compilation with gcc 4.7 is now supported.

-  Using MurmurHash for better hashing.  

-  Zoltan supports PT-Scotch v5.1.12 and ParMETIS v4, as well as some older
   versions of these TPLs. 

-  Zoltan's graph build has been streamlined; if possible, use the parameter
   "GRAPH_BUILD_TYPE" == "FAST_NO_DUP" for faster graph builds.
