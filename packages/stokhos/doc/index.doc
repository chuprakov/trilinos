\section stokhos_intro Introduction 
Stokhos is a Trilinos package for applying intrusive stochastic Galerkin
uncertainty quantification methods to nonlinear dynamical systems, primarily
stochastic partial differential equations.

\section stokhos_startup Overview of stokhos

Stokhos provides three types of capabilities

<ul> 

<li> Classes for generating stochastic residual coefficients using 
automatic differentiation with Sacado:  Stokhos::OrthogPolyExpansion 
<li> Classes for forming and solving stochastic Galerkin linear systems:
Stokhos::MatrixFreeEpetraOp
<li> Classes for providing a nonlinear interface to nonlinear stochastic
Galerkin problems:  Stokhos::SGModelEvaluator.

</ul>

\section stokhos_browser Browse all of stokhos as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Stokhos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Stokhos software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of stokhos</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
