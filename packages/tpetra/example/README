This directory contains example codes that show how to use Tpetra.
Trilinos' build system will automatically build and test these codes
whenever testing examples is enabled.

Lessons for new Tpetra users
============================

If you are learning how to use Tpetra, please begin with the
subdirectories whose names start with "Lesson" (e.g., Lesson01-Init).
The numbers that follow "Lesson" suggest an order in which to do the
lessons, and the name that follows the number indicates the lesson's
topic.

Other examples
==============

The advanced/ subdirectory contains examples best suited for either
advanced Tpetra users or Tpetra developers.  The old/ subdirectory
contains old examples that we plan either to remove or to rewrite.
Finally, the not-built/ subdirectory contains examples that were not
being built or tested; we left them as they were.

Note to Tpetra developers
=========================

How to add a new Lesson
-----------------------

1. Create a Lesson subdirectory of the appropriate name.

The numbers that follow "Lesson" suggest an order in which to do the
lessons, and the name that follows the number indicates the lesson's
topic.  You are allowed to change the numbers of other lessons in
order to put your lesson in the right place.

2. In that subdirectory, add an index.doc file.  

Imitate Lesson01-Init/index.doc.  This file uses Doxygen markup.  If
you want to add example source codes (see Step 3 below), point to them
by using the Doxygen \example command.  You may point to one or more
examples in your index.doc file.

3. In that subdirectory, add example source code(s), if any.

Look at Lesson01-Init/lesson01_mpi_only_through_Tpetra.cpp as an
example.  The top of the file has Doxygen markup which marks the file
as an example, and points back to the Lesson which uses the example.

4. To that subdirectory, add a CMakeLists.txt file to tell CMake how
   to build the examples.

Look at Lesson01-Init/CMakeLists.txt for an example.  This follows the
pattern of other Tpetra tests.  Be sure that your test generates the
right output string to stdout so that the test passes.  You may change
this string in your CMakeLists.txt file, but the standard pass output
is "End Result: TEST PASSED".
