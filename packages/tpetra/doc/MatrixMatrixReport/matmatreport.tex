\begin{abstract}
Over the course of the last year, a Matrix-Matrix Multiplication routine has been developed for the Tpetra package.
The of this routine is based the same algorithm that is used in EpetraExt with some heavy modifications. Since it 
achieved a working state two major optimizations have been in an effort to speed up the routine. This paper will
discuss the optimizations made to the routine, it's current state, and where future work needs to be done.

\section{Basic Outline of the Algorithm}
The Tpetra Matrix-Matrix algorithm allows two matrices (A and B) to be multiplied. The result of this multiplication is then placed in a third matrix (C).
The basic algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Aprime and Bprime are created from A and B. If it has been specified that A should be transposed, an actual transpose of the matrix is created
  and assigned to Aprime. Otherwise Aprime is simply equals to A. The same is done for creating Bprime.
  \item A ``view'' of Aprime and a ``view'' of Bprime are created. These views provide fast access to informaiton that will be needed later in the
  algorithm. In addition, any importations of off-elements is done. Namely, all the rows in Bprime that contain columns needed by the local copy of
  Aprime are imported.
  \item The sparsity pattern of C is determined by doing a dry run of the multiplication of Aprime and Bprime. In this run, column indicies for 
  C are computed and used to construct a graph.
  \item The actual multiplication of Aprime and Bprime is done by iterating through each row of Aprime. For each row in Aprime, every row in Bprime is
  looped through and the appropriate calculations are done.
  \item Unless indicated otherwise by the user, fillComplete is called on matrix C.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Removal of specific transpose mode kernels}
In the original ExpetraExt algorithm there was actually a seperate kernel for each possible transpose combination (e.g. A\mahts{T}*B, A*B\mahts{T}, and A\mahts{T}*B\mahts{T}).
Some of these kernels relied on a function calls find\_rows\_constaining\_columns. The relevant things to know about this function is that one of it's
arguemnts was a matrix and during execution it created an array that was of size NumberOfColumns+2*NumberOfProcessors+NumberOfProcessors*NumberOfRows.
Obviously this is not scalable because at anything but the lowest processor counts, this array quickly ballons to a size that won't fit in memory. We 
decided to just remove this function and the specific transpose kernels. Tpetra has a very fast tranposer that we now use which allows us to take
what ever the given matricies are, transpose them to the users specification, and then just use the regular A*B kernel.

\section{Optimization}
Two optimizations were implemented on top of the original working Tpetra Matrix-Matrix multiply.
\subsection{Fixing the sort in fillComplete}
As part of it's algorithm, the fillComplete function relies on a function called sort2. This function performs a sort on two arrays by sorting the first
array and concurrently doing the same permuations on the second matrix, i.e. both arrays are sorted according to the ordering of the first array. The main
use case for this function is sorting and indices arrray and moving the values in a values array so that they stay matched up with their associated index.

Up until recently, the sort2 function relied on an insertion sort algorithm. We modified the function so that it first checks to see if the arrays are 
already sorted (which happens quite often) and returns right away if they are. If the arrays are not sorted, a quicksort is preformed on the arrays.

\subsection{Removing unnessecary computation in the graph building routine}
The original algorithm from EptraExt used the same function for both building the graph of matrix C and calculating it's values. This means that while
the graph was being calculated, so were are the vaules for matrix C. But when building the graph, all the results of the values calculation are just thrown
out. It's not until the function is called again that the values calculated are actually inserted into matrix C. We modified this function so that it
takes an argument which indicates whether or not we're just calculating the graph for matrix C. If we're just calculating the graph, all the value 
calculation is skipped.

\section{Areas for future improvement}
\subsection{Kokkos Kernel}
The actual computation kernel should be moved down into Kokkos where it can better take advantage node-parallelism. This should offer non-trivial speedups.

\subsection{Improvment of underlying tpetra architecture}
The biggest thing that will help the Matrix Multiply routine improving the underlying tpetra arhcitecture. No doubt the ineffiecient sort2 routine isn't the
only problem with Tpetra at large. There have been reports from other scientists at sandia that things like the Tpetra Import class are not running as
nearly as fast as their Epetra counterparts. These things need to be investigated.
