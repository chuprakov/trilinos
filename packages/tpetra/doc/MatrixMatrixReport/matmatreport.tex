\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Over the course of the last year, a matrix-matrix multiplication routine has been developed for the Tpetra package.
This routine is based the same algorithm that is used in EpetraExt with some heavy modifications. Since it 
achieved a working state, several major optimizations have been in an effort to speed up the routine. This paper will
discuss the optimizations made to the routine, it's current state, and where future work needs to be done.

\section{Basic Outline of the Algorithm}
The Tpetra matrix-matrix multiply algorithm allows two matrices (A and B) to be multiplied. The result of this 
multiplication is then placed in a third matrix (C).
The basic algorithm is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Aprime and Bprime are created from A and B. If it has been specified that A should be transposed, an actual 
  transpose of the matrix is created and assigned to Aprime. Otherwise Aprime is simply equals to A. The same is done for 
  creating Bprime.
  \item A ``view'' of Aprime and a ``view'' of Bprime are created. These views provide fast access to informaiton that 
  will be needed later in the algorithm. In addition, any importations of off-processor elements is done. Namely, all the 
  rows in Bprime that contain columns needed by the local copy of Aprime are imported.
  \item The sparsity pattern of C is determined by doing a dry run of the multiplication of Aprime and Bprime. In this run, 
  column indicies for C are computed and used to construct a graph.
  \item The actual multiplication of Aprime and Bprime is done by iterating through each row of Aprime. For each row in 
  Aprime, every row in Bprime is looped through and the appropriate calculations are done.
  \item Unless indicated otherwise by the user, fillComplete is called on matrix C.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Optimization}

\section{Removal of Specific Transpose Mode Kernels}
In the original ExpetraExt algorithm there was actually a seperate kernel for each possible transpose combination 
(e.g. A\mahts{T}*B, A*B\mahts{T}, and A\mahts{T}*B\mahts{T}).
Some of these kernels relied on a function calls find\_rows\_constaining\_columns. The relevant things to know about this 
function is that one of it's arguemnts was a matrix and during execution it created an array that was of size 
NumberOfColumns+2*NumberOfProcessors+NumberOfProcessors*NumberOfRows.
Obviously this is not scalable. At anything but the lowest processor counts, this array quickly ballons to a size that 
won't fit in memory. We decided to just remove this function and the specific transpose kernels. Tpetra has a very fast 
tranposer that we now use instead. We take what ever the given matricies are, transpose them to the users specification, 
and then just use the regular A*B kernel. This has \emph{significant} performance benifits when doing operations like 
A\mahts{T}*B.

\subsection{Fixing FillComplete's Sort}
As part of it's algorithm, the fillComplete function relies on a function called sort2. This function performs a sort 
on two arrays by sorting the first array and concurrently doing the same permuations on the second matrix, 
i.e. both arrays are sorted according to the ordering of the first array. The main use case for this function is sorting 
an indices arrray and moving the values in a values array so that they stay matched up with their associated index.

Up until recently, the sort2 function relied on an insertion sort algorithm. We modified the function so that it first 
checks to see if the arrays are already sorted (which happens quite often) and returns right away if they are. 
If the arrays are not sorted, a quicksort is preformed on the arrays.

\subsection{Streamlining the Graph Building Routine}
The original algorithm from EptraExt used the same function for both building the graph of matrix C and calculating it's 
values by doing two passes through the function with different data. 
As a result, on the first pass through the fuction when the graph was being calculate, the vaules for matrix C were also 
calculate, but thrown out. It's not until the second pass through the function 
that the values calculated are actually inserted into matrix C. We modified this function so that it
takes an argument which indicates whether or not we're just calculating the graph for matrix C. If we're just calculating 
the graph, all the value calculation is skipped.

\section{Performance}
We conducted a seires of weak-scailing studies on the Hopper NERSC machine. Hopper is a Cray XE6 with 24 cores
per-node~\footnote{For more machine infomation regarding Hopper, please visit \url{https://www.nersc.gov/systems/hopper-cray-xe6}}.

\subsection{Comparison of Developement Stages}
Figure~\ref{tpetracomptime} and Figure~\ref{tpetracompeff} show the test results of comparing the Tpetra matrix multiply 
routine at various stages of it's 
developement.  The tests were as such: Two matricies were constructed using a Laplace3D stencil. Each node was assigned 
$110^3$ number of rows from each matrix. Then the two matrices were multiplied together. The multiplication is what 
we timed. We ran these experiments three times for each node count, and then averaged the results.
The red line represents the routine as it was when we first got the routine working. The blue line is from after 
we fixed the sort2 algorithm problem. And the purple line represents the routine after all optimizations had been applied.
As can be clearly seen, the optimizations we applied helped the algorithm substantially.

\subsection{Tpetra vs. EpetraExt vs. ML}
Figure~\ref{totaltime} and Figure~\ref{totaleff} show the test results of comparing the Tpetra matrix multiply routine 
(with all of it's optimizations) compared to the other matrix multiply routines in Trilinos (namely the original EpetraExt 
routine and two ML routines). These tests were conducted in the same manner as our development stages comparison. 
The encouraging thing about these results is that the Tpetra algorithm is as-good-as if not better than the EpetraExt 
algorithm at scale. It should be noted that the ML lines are cut short because at the next step in our testing, 
they would fail due to a memory error. So we could not run tests for greater problem sizes with ML. It's also worth noting
that in terms of efficiency, Tpetra seems to scale much better than all the rest.

\subsection{Transpose Mode Tests}
Since Tpetra and EpetraExt differ widly when it comes to transpose modes, we decided to compare the two. We did the same
tesing procedure as in the development stages comparison, except that we requested A be transposed. Figure~\ref{transtime}
and Figure~\ref{transeff} show the results. To say that the Tpetra
algorithm scales better than the EpetraExt one would be a gross understatment. We attempted ot conduct a similar 
experiment where we transposed B instead of A, but the EpetraExt algorithm was taking even longer (over ten minutes on a 
single node of Hopper) and we didn't want to waste our limited computing resources. ML is not included in these results
because it does not have a transpose mode.

\section{Areas for future improvement}
\subsection{Improvment of Underlying Tpetra Architecture}
The most important thing that will help the matrix multiply routine is to improve the underlying tpetra arhcitecture. 
No doubt the ineffiecient sort2 routine is the only problem with Tpetra at large. There have been reports from other 
scientists at sandia that things like the Tpetra Import/Export classes are not running as nearly as fast as their Epetra 
counterparts. These things need to be investigated, and fixed if necessary.

\subsection{Kokkos Kernel}
The actual computation kernel should be moved down into Kokkos where it can better take advantage node-parallelism. 
This should offer non-trivial speedups and not be very difficult to implement.

\subsection{Possible Implementation of ML's Algorithm}
ML has a matrix multiply routine that employs a complex hashing scheme inorder to speed up lookup times for 
column indicies. ML's matrix matrix multiplication algorithm is fast, but it's not clear to the current tpetra developers 
how much the hasing scheme has to do with ML's speed. That said, it is definently worth investigating. ML's hashing scheme 
is complex. Figure~\ref{hashalgo} outlines in psuedo code the algorithm as current tpetra developers 
understand it. While maybe not as easy as implementing a kokkos kernel, this shouldn't be that difficult to write.

1. For matrix B only, create a hashtable where given a globalid, 
we get a unique hastag. i.e. hash[gid] = hashtag
Note that in Serial we don't actually need a "hash", local id's should suffice
2.Create a "reverse" map, one where we can do rmap[hastag] = gid
3. Allocate an array called acc_index with the same size as the hash table
4. Allocate two arrays called acc_col and acc_val whose size is 
equal to the maximum number of row entries in matrix A.
5. For each row i in A{
  acc_index.fill(-1)
  ArrayView cur_A_cols;
  ArrayView cur_A_vals;
  A->getRowView(i, cur_A_cols, cur_A_vals);
  curr_acc_ptr=0;

    ArrayView cur_B_cols;
    ArrayView cur_B_vals;
    (B or Bimport)->getRowView(k, cur_B_cols, cur_B_vals);
    for(j=0; j< cur_B_cols.size(); ++j){
      cur_acc_index = hashtable(getGlobalElement(cur_B_cols[j])) //precomputing this might be useful
      if(acc_index(cur_acc_index) == -1){
        acc_col[cur_acc_prt] = cur_acc_index  //Probably should just put in gid actually
        acc_val[cur_acc_ptr] = cur_B_vals[j]*cur_A_vals[k]
        acc_index[curr_acc_index]=cur_acc_ptr++
      }
      else{
        acc_val[acc_index(cur_acc_index)] += cur_B_vals[j]*cur_A_vals[k]
      }
    }

  c.insertGlobalVals(i, (Globla_ids_of_hashes(acc_col))(0, curr_acc_ptr), acc_val(0,cur_acc_ptr))
