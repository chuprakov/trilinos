Still need to do the following:

1. make apply work with multivectors that have more than 1 column

2. make apply work in parallel (import/export vectors)

3. implement apply for transpose

4. add more data accessors/manipulators:
  - putScalar
  - sumInto for both local and global block-entries
  - set for local block-entries
  - get for local block-entries

5. make set/suminto/get work after fillComplete has been called.
