Still need to do the following:

1. make apply work with multivectors that have more than 1 column

2. implement apply for transpose
  (including in parallel)

3. add more data accessors/manipulators:
  - putScalar
  - sumInto for both local and global block-entries
  - set for local block-entries
  - get for local block-entries

4. make set/suminto/get work after fillComplete has been called.
