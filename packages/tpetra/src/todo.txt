* Add support for alpha,beta in CrsMatrix::apply(alpha,X,beta,Y) 
  - this will need to go all the way down to DefaultSparseMultiply
  - implemented documented conditional structure in apply(alpha,X,beta,Y)

* Decide whether RowMatrix should derive from Operator

* modify solve<DScalar,RScalar>, multiply<DScalar,RScalar> 
  - ... to operate on pre-imported multivectors, returning un-exported multivectors
  - add decorator class to import/apply/export
  - use one of these decorators in apply()
  - document well

* Add Tpetra::MultiScalarOperator abstract interface.

* Add Operator wrappers for Tifpack::Preconditioner (forward/backward), CrsMatrix (single/multi-scalar solve, multi-scalar multiply).
