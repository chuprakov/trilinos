      Parameters:

      - "No Nonlocal Changes" (\c bool): Default is false.  If true,
        the caller promises that no modifications to nonowned rows
        have happened on any process since the last call to
        fillComplete.  This saves a global all-reduce to check whether
        any process did a nonlocal insert.  Nonlocal changes include
        any sumIntoGlobalValues or insertGlobalValues call with a row
        index that is not in the row Map of the calling process.

      - "Sort column Map ghost GIDs" (\c bool): Default is true.
        makeColMap() (which fillComplete may call) always groups
        remote GIDs by process rank, so that all remote GIDs with the
        same owning rank occur contiguously.  By default, it always
        sorts remote GIDs in increasing order within those groups.
        This behavior differs from Epetra, which does not sort remote
        GIDs with the same owning process.  If you don't want to sort
