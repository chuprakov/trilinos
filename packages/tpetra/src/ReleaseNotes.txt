Release Notes for Trilinos Package Tpetra
-----------------------------------------


Trilinos 10.4:
--------------

Note to users:

The Trilinos release 10.4 came at an unfortunate time, as we were in the middle
of a medium refactor in Kokkos/Tpetra in order to better support GPU and
multicore nodes. Therefore, there has been some potential regression in performance
for GPU nodes; and some known issues regarding multi-core CPU performance (especially 
on NUMA platforms) have not been addressed. The rest of this refactor is likely to happen 
in the development branch, and will not be released until 10.6 (estimated for September 2010). 

Users that require access to this code should contact a Trilinos developer regarding access to the 
development branch repository.

--------------------------------------------------

(*) Improvements to doxygen documentation.
- added ifdefs to support profiling/tracing of host-to-device memory transfers 
  These are enable via cmake options
  -D Kokkos_CUDA_NODE_MEMORY_PROFILING:BOOL=ON
  -D Kokkos_CUDA_NODE_MEMORY_TRACE:BOOL=ON

(*) VBR capability (experimental)
- added variable-block row matrix (VbrMatrix) and underlying support classes (BlockMap, BlockMultiVector)
- added power method example of VBR classes

(*) CrsMatrix:
- now implements DisbObject, allowing import/export capability with CrsMatrix objects (experimental)
- combined LocalMatVec and LocalMatSolve objects into a single template parameter. (non BC)
  this required changes to CrsMatrixMultplyOp and CrsMatrixSolveOp operators as well. (non BC)
- access default for this type via Kokkos::DefaultKernels
- removed cached views of object data. this should have no effect on CPU-based nodes, but will result in slower performance
  for GPU-based nodes. this regression is a result of the release happening mid-refactor. it will not be addressed in the 
  10.4.x sequence.
- bug fixes regarding complex cases involving user-specified column maps and graphs.

(*) DistObject interface:
- added createViews(), releaseViews() methods to allow host-based objects to temporarily cache views of host data during import/export procedure

(*) Map: 
- added new non-member constructors: createContigMap(), createWeightedContigMap(), createUniformContigMap()
- fixed some bugs regarding use of unsigned Ordinal types
- fixed MPI-stalling bug in getRemoteIndexList()

(*) MultiVector:
- added view methods offsetView() and offsetViewNonConst() to create a MultiVector view of a subset of rows
- added non-member constructor Tpetra::createMultiVector(map,numVecs)

(*) Vector:
- added non-member constructor Tpetra::createVector(map)

(*) Tpetra I/O:
- added Galeri-type methods for generating pedagogical matrices (currently, only 3D Laplacian)

(*) External adaptors (experiemental)
- Efficiency improvements for Belos/Tpetra adaptors
- Brought Anasazi/Tpetra adaptors back online
