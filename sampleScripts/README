This directory (Trilinos/sampleScripts) contains scripts that have been 
used to invoke the Trilinos configure script on various platforms.
Users are encouraged to contribute to this directory.  The scripts
are meant to be examples only; the exact scripts will probably not
meet a user's needs.  Please note that not all of the scripts in this
directory are kept up to date when Trilinos configuration options are
added or changed, or when the operating system or compilers on machines
are upgraded.
