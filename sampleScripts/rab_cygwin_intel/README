Here I document my attempt to get Trilinos to build with the Intel C++ 9.0 and
Fortran 9.0 compilers for Windows under cygwin.  One of the biggest chalanges
was just getting the compilers to work from the cygwin command-line.  What I
finally came up with for a solution to this first problem was to create two
scripts.  The first unix script 'set_env_icl' (in this directory) I call from
the cygwin environment.  This script call the DOS script '_set_env_icl.bat'
(also in this directory) that then invokes the *.bat scripts that where
installed by the Intel C++ and Fortran install programs.  In this *.bat script
I then call back the cygwin shell and I am back in cygwin ready to be used to
configure and build.  The 'do-configure' script that I then used to configure
and build Trilinos is also in this directory.

This solution has the advantage that I did not have to manually mess with any
environment varables.

To make this work for another Windows machine, here are some things that you
need to do:

1) Install cygwin, MS Visual .NET 2003, Intel C++, Intel Fortran etc.

2) Modify the scripts 'set_env_icl' and '_set_env_icl.bat' for our machine

3) Modify the file 'do-configure' for your mahine and build location.

Oh, I forgot to mention that you also have to get the BLAS and LAPACK to work.
You can instal the Intel MKL (as I have done here) or you will have to build
them from scratch yourself with the Intel Fortran compiler!

Warning, I got lots of link-time warnings and even messages that looked like
errors but the linker finished anyway.  I don't claim that Trilinos works with
these compilers 100%.  Also note that several link commands fail the first
time through but went through the second time okay.  So just keep typing make
and it should all build.

Note that I had to modify several aspects of the test suite to get it to work
including a small change to the 'runtests' perl script.
